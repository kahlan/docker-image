How to use and maintain this repository
=======================================

All operations are automated as much as possible.

- Images and description [on Docker Hub][1] will be automatically rebuilt on
  [pushes to `master` branch][2] and on updates of parent Docker images.
- [Travis CI][3] is used only for tests.
- Generation of each `Dockerfile` and its context is automated via `Makefile`.



## Updating

To update versions of images following steps are required:

1.  Update all required versions in `Makefile` (`ALL_IMAGES` matrix).
2.  Update all required versions in `README.md`.
3.  If you need to modify some `Dockerfile`s then do it via editing
    [`Dockerfile.tmpl.php` template](Dockerfile.tmpl.php).
4.  Regenerate all `Dockerfile`s and their context (it's okay to remove previous
    ones completely):
    ```
    make src-all
    ```
5.  If `Dockerfile`s layout was changed somehow (major version change, for
    example), you should check [build triggers on Docker Hub][2] and 
    [Travis CI configuration](.travis.yml), modify them as required
    BEFORE push to `master` branch.
6.  Push changes to `master` branch.



## Testing

To run tests for all possible image versions, just do:
```
make test-all prepare-images=yes
```

It will build images for each `Dockerfile` and run those images against
[`/test/suite.bats`](test/suite.bats).



## Manual release

It's still possible to build, tag and push images manually.
Just use:
```bash
make release-all
```

It will build all existing `Dockerfile`s, tag them with proper tags
([as `README.md` requires][4]) and push them to Docker Hub.
